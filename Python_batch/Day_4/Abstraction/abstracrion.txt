"ABC" --> Abstract Base Class, is used for creating abstract classes
--> an abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiate and is designed to be a base class for other class
--> common interface for a group of subclasses

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
class MyAbstractClass(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def my_abstract_method(self):
        pass


#implement abstract method in subclasses

for the example 
class concreateclass(MyAbstractClass):
    def my_abstract_method(self):
        print("implement of the abstract method)
