-> our program around functions i.e blocks of statements that manipulate data.This is called the procedural-oriented way of programming

-> There is another way of organizing your program which is to combine data and functionaity and wrap it inside something called an object. this is called as object-oriented programming

OOP's concepts:
-> class
-> objects
-> polymorphism
-> Encapsulation
-> inhe


class

- > a class is an collection of object
- > a class is a blueprint for how something should be defined 
- >  class define the functions call method which identify the behivieros that an object create from the class can perform with its data

Object:
-> object are anything that has properties and some behaviours 
- > the rpoperty of the object are reffered as variables
- > behaviours - > functions of the object
- > the properties that all object have are define in a method called  __init__() 

-> __init__ set he initial state of the objects
