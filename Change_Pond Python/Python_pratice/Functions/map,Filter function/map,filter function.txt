map filer and reduce are paradiges of function programming
map and filter com build with python(build in function)
reduce , need to be imported as in  resiside in the functools libary or moduls

syntax(filter):
filter(function,itrable):
    -> function: it  tests if each element of a sequance    and it will return the True or False
    -> itrabel(squance)  -> which need to be filter it can be list, tuple, set, dict,string

Lamda_function(anonymous function ): -> function withoud function name
-> this function can take any number arguments but only ony one expression which is evaluated but only one expression which is evaluated and returned

syntax: lambda function 


#map function
map function return a map object(which is an itrable) of the result
after applying the given function to each items of given  itrable(list,tuple,etc)
or allow you to process and transforms all the items in an iterable
without using an explict for liip , a technique commonly know as mapping

syntax:
map(function,itrable,[iterable1,iterable2,iterable3])
